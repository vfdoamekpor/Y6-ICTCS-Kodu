## What is Kodu
Kodu lets kids create games on the PC and Xbox via a simple visual programming language. Kodu can be used to teach creativity, problem solving, storytelling, as well as programming. Anyone can use Kodu to make a game, but its recommended age is 9-14 years. 

Kodu can only be used on Windows computers (sorry Apple users!)
